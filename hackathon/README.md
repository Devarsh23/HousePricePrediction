## ML-Model-Flask-Deployment
This is a demo project to elaborate how Machine Learn Models are deployed on production using Flask API

### Prerequisites
You must have Scikit Learn, Pandas (for Machine Leraning Model) and Flask (for API) installed.

### Project Structure
This project has four major parts :
1. model.py - This contains code fot our Machine Learning model to predict employee salaries absed on trainign data in 'train.csv' file.
2. extra.py - This contains Flask APIs that receives employee details through GUI or API calls, computes the precited value based on our model and returns it.
3. request.py - This uses requests module to call APIs already defined in app.py and dispalys the returned value.
4. templates - This folder contains the HTML template to allow user to enter employee detail and displays the predicted House price.

### Running the project
This would create a serialized version of our model into a file model.pkl

1. Run extra.py using below command to start Flask API
```
python extra.py
```
By default, flask will run on port 5000.

2. Navigate to URL http://localhost:5000

You should be able to view the homepage as below link:

Enter valid numerical values in all  input boxes and hit Predict.

Or you can use the chatbot to predict the price as below link:

Also watch the exploratory data analysis as below link:

The maps iterface would look like this :

4. You can also send direct POST requests to FLask API using Python's inbuilt request module
Run the beow command to send the request with some pre-popuated values -
```
python request.py
```
